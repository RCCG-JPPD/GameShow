some errors:

timers are different/ are out of sync it needs to be the same on all possible screens when running
there is no edit question
no view all questions
questions are too small to read
if you spam the correct it gives counts the score multiple times
the display page needs to take up the whole screen
there needs to be a way to show the buzzers to all on the display page
also needs to be feedback on the buzzer so they known when they are blocked
also needs to be 
on the reveal you need to display the question as well
for more context the display page will be running on a different computer in the browser and no one will have access to it, the controll witll be controlled on a laptop and will be the game host
then various people will have buzz pages for their teams so they can buzz when needed
so display needs to be very readable - since it will be on multiple screens for everyone to read on the computer.


more issues:
can not play from pause it just resets the time
the timer sometimes covers the question 
the display needs to use 100% of the page
